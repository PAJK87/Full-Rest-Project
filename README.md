# Full-Rest-Project
 
 This repo has two seperate folders. One (Node Rest API) containing my REST API, built with Node.js and Express and made to run in a Docker Container. The second (Rest Client) contains code for a simple html page that makes the REST get calls and displays formatted information. 

## Information to Run my Development Build

If cloning this repo to your local machine this is how I build the docker image:
	1. In your terminal, navigate to the folder the Node Rest API code is in. It already inculdes a DockerFile and a Docker Compose file.
	2. To build and run the image in a container in one command use: "docker compose up"
	3. This will build the image and run it in a docker container.
